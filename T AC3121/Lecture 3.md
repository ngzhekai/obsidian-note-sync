# Chapter 3: Classical Ciphers

## 2 Main Categories of Classical Ciphers:

| | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | **Substitution** | Letters are replaced by other letters, categorized as mono-alphabetic or poly-alphabetic |
||||
| 2. | **Transposition** | Letters are arranged in a different order |
||||


## Comparison between Mono alphabetic and Poly alphabetic Ciphers

| **Monoalphabetic Cipher** | **Polyalphabetic Cipher** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Monoalphabetic cipher is one where each symbol in plain text is mapped to a fixed symbol in cipher text. | Polyalphabetic cipher is any cipher based on *substitution*, using multiple substitution alphabets.|
