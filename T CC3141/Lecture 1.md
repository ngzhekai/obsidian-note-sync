### NIST Definition of the term `Cloud Computing` 
`Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and realeased with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.`

### Three Major Categories of Cloud Service Models
- `Software as a Service (SaaS)`
- `Platform as a Service (PaaS)`
