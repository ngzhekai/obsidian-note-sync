# Introduction to Cloud Computing

### NIST Definition of the term *Cloud Computing*
> "Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction."

### ISO Definition of the term *Cloud Computing*
> "Cloud computing is a paradigm for enabling network access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable physical or virtual resources with self-service provisioning and administration on-demand."

### Simplistic terms of *Cloud Computing* by *Gartner*
> "A style of computing where scalable and elastic IT-enabled capabilities are provided as a service to multiple customers using Internet technologies."

### Key Characteristics of *Cloud Computing*
| Cloud  characteristic  | Description |
| :--------------------- | :---------- |
| On-demand self-service | Allows consumers (customers) to automatically request the service based on their needs, without human interaction with the service provider.  |
| Broad network access | Various devices can access through heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., smartphones, tablets, laptops). |
| Resource pooling | Computing resources (e.g. storage, processor, memory) are pooled together to serve multiple consumers, and are dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand. The exact location of the resources are hidden from the consumer (customer). |
| Rapid elasticity | Having the capabilities to scale up/down rapidly corresponding to the demands. |
| Measured service | Automatically control and optimise resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). |
| Multi-tenancy | A shared resource that draws on resource pooling as an important feature. It implies use of same resources by multiple consumers, called tenants.

### Three Major Categories of Cloud Service Models
- `Software as a Service (SaaS)`
- `Platform as a Service (PaaS)`
- `Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)`
