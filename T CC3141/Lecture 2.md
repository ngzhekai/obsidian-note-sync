## Virtualisation

A broad term that refers to the abstraction of computing resources, a technique for hiding the physical characteristics of computing resources (CPU, memory, disk and network interfaces) from the way in which other systems, applications, or end users interact with those resources. 
> Virtualisation creates an external interface that hides an underlying implementation by combining resources at different physical locations or by simplifying a control system.
