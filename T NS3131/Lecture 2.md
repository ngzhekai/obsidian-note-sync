## Transforming Plaintext to Ciphertext

1. Substitution - Replacing current *Char* with another *Char* in a another (e.g. shift five characters to the right, such as letter `a` will be substitute with letter `f`). Turning intelligible message into meaningless text.
2. Transposition - Transform original messages (Plaintext) into ASCII Format. Scrambles the positions of characters without changing the characters itself.
