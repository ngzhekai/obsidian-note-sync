### Overview of Cryptography

#### Two type of operation used for transforming plain text to cipher text

+ Substitution 

> replacing the letter with another letter

+ Transposition 

 > changing the sequence of the letter, while the frequency of the letter appearance is still the same
 
#### Type of key used in cryptography

1. Symmetric

> Sender and Receiver shares the same key (refer private-key encryption

2. Asymmetric 

> Sender and Receiver uses two different keys to do the encryption and decryption (refer public-key encryption)

#### Two ways which the plain text is processed

1. Block cipher

2. Stream cipher

### Five ingredients of the encryption scheme

1. Plain text
2. Encryption algorithm
3. Secret Key
4. Cipher text
5. Decryption algorithm

### Public-Key uses can be classify into these 3 categories:

1. Encryption/decryption (provide secrecy)
2. Digital signatures (provide authentication)
3. Key exchange (of session keys)
