## Overview of Cryptography

### Two type of operation used for transforming plaintext to ciphertext

+ Substitution 
> replacing the letter with another letter
+ Transposition 
 > changing the sequence of the letter, while the frequency of the letter appearance is still the same
 
### Type of key used in cryptography

1. Symmetric
> Sender and Receiver shares the same key (refer private-key encryption.
3. Asymmetric 
> Sender and Receiver uses different key to encrypt and decrypt (refer public-key encryption)
